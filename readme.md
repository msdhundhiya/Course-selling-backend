A robust backend server for a course-selling web application. This project provides a complete set of APIs to manage administrators, users, and courses, including authentication, course management, and purchasing logic.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Separate Admin and User Routes**: Secure and distinct API endpoints for administrators and users.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication middleware to protect routes.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for courses.
- **User-Specific Actions**: Allows users to view available courses and purchase them.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses Mongoose for elegant and straightforward database modeling and interaction with MongoDB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This backend is built with modern and efficient technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For securing API endpoints.
- **CORS**: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Nodemon**: For automatic server restarts during development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/msdhundhiya/Course-selling-backend.git](https://github.com/msdhundhiya/Course-selling-backend.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Course-selling-backend
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the values with your own.
    ```env
    MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    ```
    * `MONGO_URL`: Your connection string for the MongoDB database.
    * `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JWTs.

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
